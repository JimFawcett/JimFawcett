### Hi, I'm a retired Teaching Professor from the Computer Engineering Program at Syracuse University.  Before that worked in industry as a System Engineer and Software Developer. ðŸ‘‹<br />
- Now collaborating on C++, C#, and especially Rust projects.
- Started working with C++ in 1988 and, since retiring focusing a lot on Rust.
- Rust seems to have found the sweet spot for performance, memory and data race safety, and expressiveness.
- You will find a lot of repositories in this <a href="https://jimfawcett.github.io">site</a> with C++ and Rust code, with a smattering of C# <a href="https://jimfawcett.github.io/RsRepositories.html">here</a>.
